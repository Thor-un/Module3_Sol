  <h2>Our Menu</h2>
  <div id = "chicken"><h3>Chicken</h3>"It's what's for dinner." We've all heard it, and it's true: chicken breasts, thighs (our favorite cut), or even a whole bird all have a spot on our kitchen table. Unfortunately, that can mean falling into a dinner rut much too easily for our liking. If you’re like us and just can’t bear to make your (or your family’s) old standbys for the umpteenth time, we’ve got you. Get inspired with our list of best chicken dinner recipes—you’ll be sure to find a new weeknight favorite. We bet you’ve got a classic like chicken Parmesan in your rotation already, so let’s switch it up. We’ve included some fun spins on it here, like chicken Parm pasta (with everything bagel seasoning), our air fryer chicken Parm, and our chicken Parm soup. And Parmesan isn’t just for tomato sauce! We love it just as much in a garlicky, lemon cream sauce, like in our lemon asparagus chicken pasta, or paired with bread crumbs, like in our slow cooker garlic-Parmesan chicken. And don’t even get us started on Alfredo sauce. We’ve included our favorite recipe for chicken Alfredo and a few new ones too.</div>
  <div id = "pork"><h3>Pork</h3>"Pork can make a weeknight dinner feel like a true event, but the other white meat has so much more to offer than just pork chops. These variations, like our Vietnamese braised pork belly, our Chinese soup dumplings, and our Korean jajangmyeon are sure to spice up your meals. And don't worry, we've got tons of pork tenderloin, pulled pork, and roast pork loin recipes here too. We know that pork gets a bad rap for being tricky to cook, but we're here to bust that myth. Pork is such a versatile protein no matter how you flavor it or what cooking method you choose. Slow-cook your next pork roast, grill up some pork tenderloin (with plenty of chimichurri!), or even air-fry some pork chops. We love how much rich heartiness pork adds to a wide variety of dishes, like our green chili pork stew, our homemade shoyu ramen, and our tacos al pastor. With so many cuts to choose from, there's a pork dish for practically every day of the month. And not just for special occasions either! Our pork fried rice, slow roasted pork and peppers, and sheet-pan pork chops with apples are easy repeat favorites for a reason. Whether you've got pork chops or baby back ribs on the menu, you've got to have some worthy side dishes to complete your dinner. We've rounded up all our favorite side dishes for pork no matter what flavor-direction you take, from classic mashed potatoes and Instant Pot applesauce to miso roasted carrots and beer braised cabbage."</div>
  <div id = "beef"><h3>Beef</h3>"It's definitely what's for dinner tonight. If you've found yourself in an inevitable cooking rut (or reaching for the takeout menu), searing up a juicy steak, simmering chuck roast in a massaman curry, or even just frying up a classic cheeseburger will quickly liven up any weeknight. With so many cuts to consider, our best beef recipes mean you could truly have a new hearty and filling meal every night of the month and then some! No matter which cut you choose (even if you go the ultra-simple ground beef route), you can't deny how versatile beef is. And if you're new to cooking beef (or even just a little bit intimidated by it), it's way simpler than you'd expect. Some cuts like short ribs, beef tenderloin, and corned beef brisket benefit from slower braises and roasts (which means minimal babysitting), while steaks cook up fast and really benefit from keeping things super-simple. Speaking of steaks, every member of Team Delish has their own favorite cut of steak, and we think each home cook should have a killer steak technique in their back pocket. Not sure which cut of steak to grill? We've got a guide to all the kinds of steak every home cook should know, including favorites like filet mignon, strip steak (which we love for steak and eggs), and sirloin (especially in our steak au poivre soup recipe). At the end of the day, nothing beats cooking a steak on a hot skillet, good flaky salt, and simply listening for that beautiful sizzle. We have a pretty good feeling you'll be a grill-master in no time!</div>
